    "# [N-Puzzle](00_main_report.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "N-Puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. The puzzle also exists in other sizes, particularly the smaller 8-puzzle. If the size is 3×3 tiles, the puzzle is called the 8-puzzle or 9-puzzle, and if 4×4 tiles, the puzzle is called the 15-puzzle or 16-puzzle. Names for other sizes are [n-puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-puzzle) where n is the number of tiles. If the size is 2×2 tiles, the puzzle is called the 4-puzzle or 5-puzzle, and if 5×5 tiles, the puzzle is called the 25-puzzle or 26-puzzle. The objective of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.\n",
